# Dust Test Drive: FAQ Bot No-Code Speedrun

**Time Box: 30 minutes MAX**

## The Sticky Problem

Your overnight MVP service is blowing up but fr fr you're drowning in the same client questions. "What's included?" "How long does it take?" "Can you build [insert wild idea]?" 

Time to test if Dust's no-code AI agents can handle these FAQs without you becoming a human chatbot. No cap.

## Success Metrics

‚úÖ **Win**: Never manually typing "Our overnight MVP includes..." ever again
‚ùå **L**: Agent gives sus answers that confuse clients more than helping

## The 30-Minute Challenge

### Phase 1: Agent Setup (10 mins)
- [ ] Create new Dust workspace (if needed)
- [ ] Build FAQ agent with your service deets
- [ ] Input your actual service info:
  - What's included in overnight MVP
  - Pricing structure 
  - Timeline expectations
  - What you DON'T build
  - Contact process

### Phase 2: Client Question Gauntlet (10 mins)
Test these 5 common client Qs:
1. "What exactly do I get with your overnight MVP?"
2. "How much does this cost?"
3. "Can you build me an app like Uber but for dogs?"
4. "What if I need changes after delivery?"
5. "Do you do ongoing support?"

**Vibe Check**: Are answers accurate? Would you send these to actual clients?

### Phase 3: Team Accessibility Test (5 mins)
- [ ] Have non-tech team member update one FAQ answer
- [ ] Test if they can add new question/answer pair
- [ ] Check if they broke anything lowkey

### Phase 4: Real World Deploy (5 mins)
- [ ] Embed agent on test landing page (if Dust supports)
- [ ] Send test link to one trusted client for feedback
- [ ] Document any rage quit moments

## Key Questions to Answer

1. **Setup Difficulty**: Can you build this without touching code? Be so fr.
2. **Answer Quality**: Do responses sound human or like ChatGPT's boring cousin?
3. **Customization**: Can you match your brand voice or is it giving corporate NPC?
4. **Team Usability**: Can your VA update this without calling you?
5. **Client Experience**: Would actual clients use this or bounce immediately?

## What We're Really Testing

- Does no-code = no headache? Or hidden complexity?
- Can Dust agents handle nuanced questions about your specific service?
- Is this actually faster than just answering DMs yourself?
- Will this scale when you're getting 50+ inquiries daily?

## Document Everything

Screenshot or it didn't happen:
- Agent creation process
- Test conversations
- Any error messages
- Team member attempting updates
- Client reactions (if you get that far)

## Post-Test Reflection

After 30 mins, answer honestly:
- Would you actually use this for real clients?
- Time saved vs manual FAQ responses?
- Hidden costs or limitations discovered?
- Better than hiring a VA to handle FAQs?

Remember: The goal isn't to build the perfect FAQ bot. It's to test if Dust can handle basic client questions without you. If it takes longer than 30 mins to set up, that's already an L.

Good luck, and may your DMs finally know peace. üíÄ

*Note: This test assumes you already have clear FAQ answers for your service. If you don't, that's a different problem bestie.*
