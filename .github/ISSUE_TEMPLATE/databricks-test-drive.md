## 🧱 Databricks Test Drive: From Zero to "Yeah, We Can Handle Your Data"

**Time Box:** 30 minutes MAX (no cap, set that timer)

### 😬 The Sticky Situation

Client drops the dreaded question: "Can you handle our data infrastructure?" You've never touched Databricks but heard it's the move. Can you get competent enough in 30 minutes to not look like you're frantically googling under the table?

### 🎯 The Mission

Go from Databricks noob to someone who can talk intelligently about data pipelines without sweating through your shirt. This ain't about becoming a data engineer - it's about not looking clueless when money's on the line.

**Core Requirements:**
- [ ] Get into Databricks without needing IT support
- [ ] Upload actual data (not just "test123")
- [ ] Run analysis that proves you know what a notebook is
- [ ] Create one viz that doesn't look like Excel 2003

### 🏃‍♂️ The Speedrun

**0-5 mins: Account Setup**
- [ ] Free trial signup (pray it doesn't need credit card)
- [ ] Navigate the UI without getting lost
- [ ] Find where tf you upload data

**5-15 mins: Data Upload & Exploration**
- [ ] Upload a real dataset (sales data, user logs, whatever's not trash)
- [ ] Load it into a table without breaking everything
- [ ] Run basic queries to prove you can SQL

**15-25 mins: Basic Analysis**
- [ ] Create a notebook (Jupyter vibes but corporate)
- [ ] Write some Python/SQL that actually returns results
- [ ] Do ONE meaningful calculation (averages don't count, be better)

**25-30 mins: Visualization**
- [ ] Create one chart that tells a story
- [ ] Make it client-presentable (no default blue bars)
- [ ] Screenshot everything before trial expires

### 📊 Success Metrics

**W Outcome:**
- You can explain what Databricks does without sounding like you're reading Wikipedia
- Your analysis actually answers a business question
- The viz looks professional enough for a client deck
- You understand enough to estimate if their data needs are feasible

**L Outcome:**
- Still confusing Databricks with databases
- Your "analysis" is just SELECT * FROM table
- Viz looks like a middle school science project
- Client realizes you're googling "what is a data lakehouse"

### 🔥 Pro Tips

1. **Pick familiar data** - Use e-commerce or SaaS metrics you understand
2. **Start with SQL** - Don't try to flex with Scala on day one
3. **One good insight > ten basic queries** - Quality over quantity
4. **Screenshot everything** - Trials expire, evidence doesn't

### 💭 The Vibe Check

Is Databricks actually approachable for non-PhD holders? Or is it another "enterprise solution" that needs a 6-month onboarding? Time to find out if this is worth adding to your stack.

### 📝 Post-Challenge Reflection

After the timer hits 30:
- [ ] Could you handle a client's data migration conversation?
- [ ] What would you need to learn to actually deliver?
- [ ] Is the pricing gonna make clients ghost you?
- [ ] Would you recommend this over alternatives?
