## üéÆ Replit Test Drive: Squad Coding Session

**Time Box:** 30 minutes MAX (client's watching the clock fr)

### üéØ The Sticky Situation

Your remote team needs to flex coding skills LIVE. Client's on the call watching you build something from scratch. Can your squad collab smoothly or will it look like a chaotic Discord gaming session? Time to prove remote teams aren't just vibing in their PJs.

### üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è The Mission

Get 2-3 devs in a Replit workspace, build something impressive while the client watches, and deploy before they lose interest. This is your team's audition tape.

**Core Requirements:**
- [ ] Live multiplayer coding (no turn-based nonsense)
- [ ] Build something visual the client can understand
- [ ] Deploy it before the call ends (or it didn't happen)
- [ ] Look coordinated AF (not like y'all just met)

### ‚è±Ô∏è The Speedrun

**0-5 mins: Setup & Introductions**
- [ ] Spin up fresh Replit workspace (share link ASAP)
- [ ] Get all devs connected (test mics/cursors working)
- [ ] Quick intro: who's building what (assign roles or it's chaos)
- [ ] Client can see everyone's cursors moving (the magic moment)

**5-20 mins: Build Phase**
- [ ] Frontend dev starts UI (something pretty for client to see)
- [ ] Backend dev handles logic (API routes or game mechanics)
- [ ] Third dev on polish/features (animations, edge cases, etc.)
- [ ] Communicate in chat/voice (no awkward silence)

**20-25 mins: Integration & Testing**
- [ ] Merge everyone's work (this is where teams usually fumble)
- [ ] Quick bug fixes (there will be bugs, no cap)
- [ ] Make sure it actually runs (prayer circle time)

**25-30 mins: Deploy & Demo**
- [ ] Hit that deploy button (Replit makes this easy or you're cooked)
- [ ] Share live URL with client
- [ ] Quick demo of what you built
- [ ] Drop the mic (figuratively)

### üí° Project Ideas (Pick ONE)

**Option 1: Collaborative Drawing App**
- Multiple users can draw together
- Different colors per user
- Clear button to reset
- Shows teamwork + real-time features

**Option 2: Team Task Tracker**
- Add/complete tasks
- Assign to team members
- Progress visualization
- Practical and relatable

**Option 3: Mini Multiplayer Game**
- Simple mechanics (think Snake or Pong)
- Multiple players
- Score tracking
- Fun factor wins clients

**Option 4: Live Polling App**
- Create polls
- Real-time voting
- Results visualization
- Interactive demo potential

### üìä Success Metrics

**W Outcome:**
- Seamless collaboration (like a well-oiled machine)
- Clear communication without talking over each other
- Working app deployed in under 30 mins
- Client thinking "these devs got their shit together"
- No visible panic when bugs appear

**L Outcome:**
- Devs stepping on each other's code
- Merge conflicts during the demo
- "Can you see my screen?" for 10 minutes
- Deployed app immediately crashes
- Looks like your first hackathon at 3am

### üöÄ Pro Tips

1. **Assign clear roles upfront** - Frontend, Backend, Polish/Deploy
2. **Use Replit's multiplayer features** - See each other's cursors, use the chat
3. **Keep it simple** - Better to nail something basic than fail at complex
4. **Communicate constantly** - "I'm working on X" prevents conflicts
5. **Have a backup plan** - If deploy fails, screen share works
6. **Energy matters** - Dead silence kills client confidence

### üé≠ The Vibe Check

This isn't just about the code - it's about proving your remote team can collaborate under pressure. Can you make distributed development look easy? Or will the client think they need an office after all?

### üìù Post-Challenge Reflection

After the timer expires:
- [ ] What was the final product?
- [ ] How smooth was the collaboration?
- [ ] Any moments of chaos? How'd you recover?
- [ ] Would the client hire your team?
- [ ] What would you do differently?

*Remember: The client isn't just judging your code - they're judging your teamwork. Make remote collaboration look like a superpower, not a limitation. No cap, all facts.*
